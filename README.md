## Introduction

This project aims to analyze and visualize house prices in Bangalore using real-world data. We've explored various aspects of the dataset, from property types and availability statuses to correlations between attributes. The goal is to provide insights that can guide potential buyers, investors, and stakeholders in the real estate market.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about Bangalore house prices, including details such as area type, availability, location, size, society, total square footage, bathroom count, balcony count, and price. Due to privacy and licensing considerations, the actual dataset is not included in this repository.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Placeholder directory for storing the dataset (not included).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis code and visualizations.
- `visualizations/`: Directory for storing visualization images.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Visualizations

We've created various visualizations to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data. These include:

- Area Chart: Distribution of properties across locations by price range.
- Line Chart: Count of availability statuses by area type.
- Donut Chart: Distribution of property availability statuses.
- Stacked Column Chart: Distribution of property types within availability statuses.
- Clustered Bar Chart: Sum of bathroom counts by property size.

These visualizations help illustrate patterns, trends, and correlations within the Bangalore house price market.
